[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Reedtrullz/codex-antigravity-auth)](https://github.com/Reedtrullz/codex-antigravity-auth/releases)

Released local gateway for using Google Antigravity Claude Opus/Sonnet from OpenAI Codex CLI or Desktop. It exposes an OpenAI Responses-compatible `http://localhost:51122/v1` endpoint, handles Google OAuth/account rotation, and keeps optional Gemini and BYOK OpenAI-compatible providers available.

The default setup is intentionally conservative: it can install the Codex provider block and start the gateway, but it will not replace your active Codex model unless you explicitly pass `--activate`.

## Quick Start

```bash
uv tool install codex-antigravity-auth
codex-antigravity setup --write --accounts 1 --model claude-sonnet-4-6 --install-skill --start
codex-antigravity setup --check --model claude-sonnet-4-6
```

To make Antigravity Claude the active Codex default, opt in explicitly:

```bash
codex-antigravity configure-codex --write --activate --model claude-sonnet-4-6
```

Use `$anti` only as an optional sidecar reviewer/planner after the gateway is working; Codex remains the acting agent.

## Features
- **Claude in Codex**: Advertises Antigravity Claude Sonnet/Opus through `/v1/models` so Codex can use the local gateway like a Responses API provider.
- **Safe setup by default**: `setup --write` and `configure-codex --write` install the provider block without changing top-level `model`/`model_provider`; `--activate` is required to switch Codex defaults.
- **Durable local service**: Supports foreground/background gateway runs plus per-user macOS LaunchAgent, Linux systemd user unit, and Windows Scheduled Task service lifecycle.
- **Diagnostics that explain the next step**: `setup --check`, `doctor --codex-ready`, `status`, `/health`, sanitized request logs, and `logs summary` help distinguish config, gateway, service, account, and provider-key issues.
- **OS-Native Keyring Encryption**: Encrypts Google account tokens and stored BYOK provider config at rest via macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service, or a private local fallback key.
- **Transaction-Safe Cooldown Rotations**: Automatically rotates accounts on backend failures (such as `401`, `403`, or `429` rate limiters) with clean exponential backoff.
- **High-Fidelity SSE Translation**: Translates stream candidate envelopes, role alignments, reasoning-text deltas, function-call items, and VALIDATED tool parameter modes into Responses API events.
- **BYOK Provider Routing**: Route model IDs like `deepseek:deepseek-v4-pro`, `xai:grok-code-fast-1`, `kimi:kimi-k2-0711-preview`, `ollama:gpt-oss:20b`, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints through encrypted API-key config.

## Installation

From PyPI:

```bash
uv tool install codex-antigravity-auth
```

From GitHub:

```bash
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/Reedtrullz/codex-antigravity-auth.git"
```

From a source checkout:

```bash
uv tool install .
```

For active development, keep it editable:

```bash
uv tool install --editable .
```

If you are already inside a project virtual environment, this also works:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

The recommended first-run path is the primary setup command. It validates OAuth credentials, prompts for missing Google OAuth desktop-client credentials on an interactive TTY, runs Google login, writes the Codex provider block only when `--write` is present, can install the optional `$anti` helper skill, starts the gateway in the background, waits for `/v1/models`, and ends with readiness diagnostics. It does not change your active default Codex model unless you add `--activate`:

```bash
codex-antigravity setup --write --accounts 1 --model claude-sonnet-4-6 --install-skill --start
```

When `--base-url` is omitted, `setup` derives `http://localhost:<port>/v1` from `--port`; if both `--start --port` and `--base-url` are supplied, their ports must match so Codex is not configured for a different gateway than the one just started.

For a read-only preflight that does not mutate OAuth, Codex config, skills, or gateway state:

```bash
codex-antigravity setup --check
codex-antigravity setup --json
codex-antigravity setup --check --live
```

`setup --check --live` adds an explicit non-streaming `/v1/responses` smoke using the selected Google Antigravity model. Use `--live-model` and `--live-timeout` to override the model or timeout. It is still read-only, but it does spend one real provider request.

After setup, inspect native Codex readiness and gateway lifecycle with:

```bash
codex-antigravity status
codex-antigravity doctor --codex-ready
codex-antigravity doctor --codex-ready --live
codex-antigravity doctor --codex-ready --json
codex-antigravity stop
```

For reboot persistence, install the per-user gateway service after a successful setup:

```bash
codex-antigravity service install --port 51122 --host 127.0.0.1
codex-antigravity service status
codex-antigravity service uninstall
```

On macOS this writes a user LaunchAgent under `~/Library/LaunchAgents`; on Linux it writes a systemd user unit under `~/.config/systemd/user`; on Windows it creates a per-user Scheduled Task. The regular `start --background` command remains the lightweight non-persistent option.

If your Codex provider block drifts, repair only the Codex config without OAuth login, skill install, or gateway mutation:

```bash
codex-antigravity setup --repair --config ~/.codex/config.toml --model claude-sonnet-4-6
```

Install or refresh the Codex provider block without changing your active default model:

```bash
codex-antigravity configure-codex --write
```

The command validates the Codex model id, provider id, provider name, and gateway base URL before writing. It updates `~/.codex/config.toml` through a private atomic write, follows an existing symlink to update the real config target, and writes a timestamped private backup first when it changes an existing config. By default it writes only `[model_providers.antigravity]`; it does not change top-level `model` or `model_provider`. Add `--activate` only when you explicitly want Antigravity to become the active Codex default.

To inspect the TOML without writing it:

```bash
codex-antigravity configure-codex
```

Install the optional Codex `$anti` helper skill that ships with this repo:

```bash
codex-antigravity install-skill
```

This copies the bundled skill into `~/.codex/skills/anti` for optional review/planning workflows after Claude is already available in Codex. It can use Antigravity Opus/Sonnet as a helper reviewer, consult lane, deep work planner, and bounded multi-model panel from chat prompts like `$anti review this diff with opus`. If you already have a local `anti` skill, the command refuses to overwrite it unless you pass `--force`; forced installs back up the existing skill under a sibling `skills-backups` directory so backups are not indexed as live skills.

To verify the V2 helper workflow surface without changing Codex config, run:

```bash
codex-antigravity setup-v2
codex-antigravity install-skill --verify
# If setup-v2 warns that an existing anti skill is stale or locally modified:
codex-antigravity install-skill --force --verify
```

`setup-v2 --write` installs or refreshes the bundled skill, but it does not write `~/.codex/config.toml`; use primary `setup --write`, `setup-google`, or `configure-codex --write` when you explicitly want the gateway provider block installed. Add `--activate` to primary `setup --write` or `configure-codex --write` only when you explicitly want Codex itself pointed at the gateway as the active default.
If an existing `anti` skill differs from the bundled copy, pass `--force` with `install-skill` or `setup-v2 --write` to back it up and replace it before verifying. BYOK provider identity/key checks are skipped by default; add `--check-byok` when you want setup-v2 to inspect provider readiness and confirm configured provider models are advertised by the running gateway.

The skill also ships a helper-level panel mode inspired by MoA/Fusion workflows. Codex remains the acting agent; the helper fans out to gateway-advertised models, asks a judge model to synthesize disagreements, structured findings, blind spots, and next actions, then returns advisory output for Codex to verify:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/anti/scripts/anti.py panel --mode review --scope staged
python3 ~/.codex/skills/anti/scripts/anti.py panel --mode plan --scope working-tree --prompt "Plan this PR"
python3 ~/.codex/skills/anti/scripts/anti.py panel --mode ask --model sonnet --model openrouter:deepseek/deepseek-chat --judge opus --prompt "Compare these approaches"
python3 ~/.codex/skills/anti/scripts/anti.py panel --mode review --scope staged --output findings
python3 ~/.codex/skills/anti/scripts/anti.py moa --mode review --model deepseek-v4-pro --judge opus --scope staged
python3 ~/.codex/skills/anti/scripts/anti.py fusion --mode plan --model opus --model deepseek-v4-pro --judge opus --scope working-tree --prompt "Plan this repository change"
```

Panel consensus is not proof and should not patch code directly. Structured findings include `id`, `claim`, `severity`, `lanes`, and `verify`; run the `verify` hint locally before acting. Findings remain `unverified` until native/local checks confirm or reject them. Text and JSON outputs include per-lane/judge usage and latency when the gateway/provider returns it. Broad review panels summarize oversized scopes once before fan-out instead of silently truncating raw context for every lane.

Panel JSON keeps requested and actual execution identities separate (`requestedModel`, `actualModel`, `provider`, `fallbackChain`, `primaryError`, and `fallbackReason`). The panel status is `complete_multi_model`, `partial_multi_model`, `same_provider_multi_model`, `degraded_single_model`, or `failed`; distinct actual provider/model identities, rather than repeated logical fallback lanes, satisfy `--min-successes`, and `--min-providers` can require provider diversity. `/v1/models` is only a catalog/readiness hint—the bounded generation call is the live model health check. Every saved run exposes top-level `runStatus`, `scopeStatus`, `panelStatus`, `coverage`, and `resultPath`.
When the diversity minimum is not met, the panel fails closed before judge synthesis; `--json` and `--output findings` still return the lane evidence and status with a non-zero exit code.

Panel lanes are selected explicitly from the native Sonnet/Opus defaults or from models advertised by the running gateway. BYOK examples include `openrouter:...`, `deepseek:...`, `xai:...`, `kimi:...`, `ollama:...`, and `opencode:...`; they require the corresponding API key or a key-optional local provider. When a BYOK lane receives repository, diff, or file context, the helper prints and records a disclosure naming the provider lane. Virtual picker models such as `panel:*`, `moa:*`, or `fusion:*` remain helper aliases rather than gateway-side fan-out.

The current xAI preset is API-key based and uses `XAI_API_KEY`. Provider availability is determined by the gateway's `/v1/models` catalog; a catalog entry is not proof that a live generation will succeed.

Repository context leaves the Google Antigravity lane only after explicit selection and the existing BYOK disclosure. Opus remains the default judge; native Codex remains the acting agent and must verify advisory output locally.

V2 named workflow presets wrap the same advisory engine for common Codex work:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/anti/scripts/anti.py workflow review-ready --scope staged
python3 ~/.codex/skills/anti/scripts/anti.py workflow plan-deep --scope working-tree --prompt "Plan this PR" --progress
python3 ~/.codex/skills/anti/scripts/anti.py workflow ship-gate --scope diff --base origin/main --json
python3 ~/.codex/skills/anti/scripts/anti.py workflow provider-compare --model sonnet --model openrouter:deepseek/deepseek-chat --prompt "Compare these approaches"
python3 ~/.codex/skills/anti/scripts/anti.py workflow provider-compare --model deepseek-v4-pro --prompt "Compare this approach with the native review lane"
python3 ~/.codex/skills/anti/scripts/anti.py workflow security-review --scope staged --output findings
python3 ~/.codex/skills/anti/scripts/anti.py workflow debug-consensus --prompt "Intermittent 502s after rotation"
python3 ~/.codex/skills/anti/scripts/anti.py runs list
```

Workflow runs save sanitized summaries under `~/.codex/anti-runs` by default; primitive `consult`, `plan`, `review`, and `panel` commands default to not writing a ledger unless `--save-output summary` or `--save-output full` is passed. Saved runs include the Anti run id, which is also sent as `metadata.run_id` to the gateway and appears in sanitized request logs for correlation. Run records never retain raw prompts: full mode keeps sanitized per-call output plus prompt hashes/counts, while summary mode keeps a short index and the complete sanitized answer in `result.json`. `plan` and `review` use a conservative Claude safety budget with `--chunked auto`, so broad Opus/Sonnet work is split into bounded chunk calls before synthesis instead of being sent as one giant request; `--chunked off` preserves exact scope and refuses when the request cannot fit, including when `--max-prompt-chars 0` is set. Partial results retain explicit non-zero exits and coverage; `--allow-partial` only permits the call, it does not make the result complete. Use `--required-file` to fail closed if priority files must be fully covered. `--fallback-model sonnet --fallback-policy on-retryable` and `--progress` are available for long-running model calls that may otherwise fail silently or hit transient backend rotation errors.

Before running `codex-antigravity login`, create a Google OAuth desktop client. The local callback listener uses:

```text
http://localhost:51121/oauth-callback
```

Then either export the client credentials:

```bash
export ANTIGRAVITY_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
export ANTIGRAVITY_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
```

Or let `codex-antigravity setup --write` prompt for them when it is run from an interactive terminal. Automation can pass `--no-input` to fail fast instead of prompting. The setup prompt writes `~/.codex/antigravity-credentials.json` through a private atomic write and rejects symlinked credential paths.

You can also write the file yourself. This client-credential file is plaintext but permission-repaired to `0600`; account tokens are stored separately in encrypted storage.

```json
{
  "client_id": "your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret"
}
```

Then run the interactive login:
```bash
codex-antigravity login
```

For first-run native Claude setup, prefer `setup --write`. For the older Google-only flow, or when you want several Google accounts in the rotation pool without installing the skill or starting the gateway, use:

```bash
codex-antigravity setup-google --accounts 2
```

`setup-google` first verifies that Google OAuth client credentials are configured, then runs the browser OAuth flow before writing Codex config. That keeps Codex config untouched if login cannot start or complete. It forces Google's account chooser for multi-account setup, stores each account in the encrypted rotation pool, clears stale cooldown state for re-authenticated accounts, writes the Codex provider block after successful login unless `--skip-codex-config` is passed, and runs the active-provider `doctor` only when `--activate` is also passed. You can also add more accounts later:

```bash
codex-antigravity login --count 2
codex-antigravity accounts
codex-antigravity accounts reset you@example.com
codex-antigravity accounts remove old@example.com --yes
```

`accounts reset <email>` clears persisted cooldown/failure state without touching saved tokens or usage counters; use `accounts reset --all --yes` for the whole rotation pool. `accounts remove <email> --yes` removes a revoked or dead account from the encrypted store and repairs active rotation indexes.

Start the local gateway:

```bash
codex-antigravity start
codex-antigravity start --background
```

Background mode writes pid/log files under `~/.codex/`. The log file is append-only and created with private permissions; remove or rotate it manually if it grows too large.

Request diagnostics are written to a sanitized capped JSONL file under `~/.codex/antigravity-requests.jsonl`. The log records request ids, model/route metadata, latency, status, retry/rotation hints, HTTP status, usage totals when available, and redacted error classes/messages. It never stores prompts, request bodies, OAuth material, provider keys, or account emails.

For Google Antigravity routes, concurrent Codex requests are spread across available accounts by process-local in-flight counts while sequential traffic keeps the sticky active account. Cooled-down accounts remain excluded from selection, and in-flight counters are released when non-streaming responses finish or streaming clients disconnect.

```bash
codex-antigravity logs --tail 20
codex-antigravity logs summary --since 24h
codex-antigravity logs --follow
codex-antigravity logs clean
curl http://127.0.0.1:51122/health
```

`logs summary` aggregates the sanitized request log by route/family with request/attempt/rotation counts, terminal outcomes, cancellations, token usage, success rate, p50/p95 latency, 429 counts, and top error classes. Individual records include the terminal reason, cooldown scope/category, and Anti `run_id` correlation when available. It never records prompts, request bodies, OAuth material, provider keys, or account emails.

The loopback-only `/health` endpoint reports process health, native model count, BYOK route visibility, anonymous account cooldown summaries, and the request-log path.

### Model catalog overlays

Built-in Claude/Gemini model definitions remain authoritative, but you can add local model-picker entries in `~/.codex/antigravity-models.toml`:

```bash
codex-antigravity models list
codex-antigravity models add claude-experimental \
  --backend-id claude-experimental-backend \
  --display-name "Claude Experimental" \
  --family claude \
  --context-window 200000 \
  --default-reasoning-level high \
  --alias claude-exp
codex-antigravity models doctor
codex-antigravity models remove claude-experimental
```

Overlay ids must be simple printable model ids, cannot shadow built-in ids, backend ids, or aliases unless `--force` is explicit, and only appear in Codex's picker when the gateway advertises them through `/v1/models`. Runtime catalog loads fail soft to built-ins if the local overlay TOML is malformed; `models list` and `models doctor` stay strict so you can find and repair the overlay. Unknown direct Google model ids can still pass through, but picker visibility requires a built-in or overlay definition.

### BYOK providers

Built-in presets are available for OpenRouter, DeepSeek, xAI, Kimi/Moonshot, Ollama, OpenCode-compatible local servers, and custom OpenAI-compatible APIs:

```bash
codex-antigravity provider presets
codex-antigravity provider set openrouter --api-key-env OPENROUTER_API_KEY --model openrouter/auto
codex-antigravity provider set deepseek --api-key-env DEEPSEEK_API_KEY --model deepseek-v4-pro --model deepseek-v4-flash
codex-antigravity provider set xai --api-key-env XAI_API_KEY --model grok-code-fast-1
codex-antigravity provider set kimi --api-key-env KIMI_API_KEY --model kimi-k2-0711-preview
codex-antigravity provider set ollama --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1 --model gpt-oss:20b
codex-antigravity provider list
```

Provider presets show their supported API-key modes and model defaults. The xAI preset uses `XAI_API_KEY` and exposes `xai:grok-build-0.1`, `xai:grok-4.3`, and `xai:grok-code-fast-1`; no provider-specific OAuth flow is part of the current preset catalog. DeepSeek exposes `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, `deepseek-chat`, and `deepseek-reasoner`.

For BYOK-only use, point Codex at a BYOK model when writing the provider block:

```bash
codex-antigravity configure-codex --write --model deepseek:deepseek-chat
# Add --activate only if you want DeepSeek to become the active Codex default.
codex-antigravity doctor --byok-only
```

`--api-key-env` avoids persisting provider keys and reads them from the gateway process environment. It may name an existing environment variable instead of the preset default, for example `codex-antigravity provider set deepseek --api-key-env DEV_DEEPSEEK_KEY`. If you intentionally want a provider key stored locally, pass `--api-key`; stored provider keys are encrypted in `~/.codex/antigravity-providers.json`. Use `--auth-mode api-key` explicitly only when you want an API-key provider config to record that mode. Built-in provider env vars include `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `KIMI_API_KEY`, `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_API_KEY`, and `OPENCODE_API_KEY`.
The `/v1/models` catalog only advertises BYOK models when the provider has a usable stored/env key or explicitly supports key-optional loopback/local use. The generic `custom` preset is not auto-enabled; run `codex-antigravity provider set custom --base-url ... --model ...` before routing `custom:model`.
When `provider set` is given `--api-key-env`, models are configured but remain hidden from `/v1/models` until that environment variable is available to the running gateway.
Provider ids reserve model-name separators and may only contain letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens; model ids themselves may still contain `/` or `:`, but not whitespace or control characters. Unknown `provider:model` prefixes are rejected as BYOK routing errors before any Google account selection.
Custom provider and Codex gateway base URLs must be absolute `http` or `https` URLs without embedded credentials, whitespace/control characters, query strings, fragments, invalid ports, or malformed bracketed hosts. Plain `http` base URLs are accepted only for loopback/local hosts; remote BYOK providers and remote gateway URLs must use `https`. Non-preset custom BYOK providers must provide a base URL before models are exposed. Stored/env BYOK API keys and extra BYOK provider header values must be printable ASCII without control characters; model-picker display names must not contain control characters. Provider API-key env var names must contain only letters, numbers, and underscores and must not start with a number. Extra headers may not override gateway-managed auth, content, host, or transport headers. Invalid BYOK provider URLs, API keys, env vars, model ids, display names, and headers are rejected before config writes; invalid BYOK provider URLs, timeouts, headers, API keys, and missing API keys are also rejected before streaming starts so Codex gets a normal HTTP error instead of a partial SSE response. Key-optional BYOK providers are only treated as keyless on loopback/local base URLs; remote custom or cloud URLs need a usable stored or env API key before they appear in Codex's picker or route requests. Function/tool names and forced `tool_choice` function names must contain only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens, and be 1-64 characters; malformed names are rejected or dropped before routing. Non-streaming Google failure responses use a structured `detail` object with `message` and sanitized `diagnostics`; clients should handle both this shape and older string details. BYOK streams surface provider error frames as failed Responses API streams instead of successful empty completions, ignore never-named tool-call deltas, and wait for complete valid streamed function names instead of emitting empty, partial, or malformed function names. BYOK structured tool outputs are serialized to JSON text before being sent as Chat Completions tool messages.

For 1Password-backed BYOK keys, keep `provider set --api-key-env` and let 1Password populate that env var for the gateway process. With today's stable 1Password CLI, create a local env file containing secret references such as:

```dotenv
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=op://Private/OpenRouter/sk
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=op://Private/DeepSeek/api_key
```

Then start the gateway through `op run` without revealing the key:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.codex/antigravity.env
codex-antigravity start --background --op-env-file ~/.codex/antigravity.env
codex-antigravity service install --port 51122 --host 127.0.0.1 --op-env-file ~/.codex/antigravity.env
```

1Password Environments beta can be used the same way once your local `op` supports `op run --environment`:

```bash
codex-antigravity start --background --op-environment <environment-id>
codex-antigravity service install --port 51122 --host 127.0.0.1 --op-environment <environment-id>
```

The 1Password CLI must be installed on `PATH` when these options are used. `start --background` and `service install` resolve `op` to an absolute path and fail before writing service manifests or starting a gateway if it is missing. Durable services still depend on your local 1Password unlock/session behavior after reboot; verify with `codex-antigravity service status` and `codex-antigravity doctor --codex-ready --live`.

The `configure-codex --write` helper writes this provider block into `~/.codex/config.toml` after validation:

```toml
[model_providers.antigravity]
name = "Google Antigravity"
base_url = "http://localhost:51122/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
```

If you deliberately pass `--activate`, it also writes the active default keys:

```toml
model = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
model_provider = "antigravity"
wire_api = "responses"
```

## Unified Codex model picker

Allows Codex to display and use OpenAI, Claude and Gemini models from a
single configured provider by routing requests through the local gateway.

This is opt-in and does not change classic behaviour unless you enable it:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
codex-antigravity configure-codex --write --unified-model-picker --model gpt-5.6
codex-antigravity start --unified-model-picker
# Or durably:
codex-antigravity service install --port 51122 --host 127.0.0.1 --unified-model-picker
```

Unified mode writes a separate provider block so classic configs are preserved:

```toml
[model_providers.antigravity-unified]
name = "Antigravity Unified"
base_url = "http://localhost:51122/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
```

```toml
model = "gpt-5.6"
model_provider = "antigravity-unified"
wire_api = "responses"
```

When enabled, `GET /v1/models` advertises Antigravity native models, OpenAI/Codex
ids (`gpt-5.6`, `gpt-5.6-codex`, …), and configured BYOK `provider:model` ids in
one picker. The gateway routes per model (BYOK → existing provider, OpenAI →
OpenAI upstream, Claude/Gemini → Antigravity) and returns provider-qualified
errors for unknown models, missing OpenAI auth, or unreachable upstreams. OpenAI
requests never fall through to Antigravity and vice versa.

OpenAI authentication, in order of preference:

1. Explicit `OPENAI_API_KEY` (env) proxied to `https://api.openai.com/v1/responses`
   (override base with `OPENAI_BASE_URL`; file alternative
   `~/.codex/antigravity-openai.json` with `{"api_key": ...}`).
2. Optional ChatGPT-subscription reuse: `ANTIGRAVITY_OPENAI_USE_CODEX_AUTH=1`
   reads `~/.codex/auth.json` (or `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`) read-only after
   `codex login` and proxies to `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`.
   No token refresh is attempted; an expired token returns a clear 401 telling
   you to run `codex login` again. This path is explicit because the auth file
   format is owned by Codex and may change.

Extend the OpenAI registry without code changes:

```bash
export ANTIGRAVITY_OPENAI_MODELS="gpt-5.6,gpt-5.6-codex,my-codex-model"
```

Disable unified mode at any time to restore historical behaviour
(`ANTIGRAVITY_UNIFIED_MODEL_PICKER` unset, classic `antigravity` provider).

## Verification

To run connection check diagnostics and verify token security:
```bash
codex-antigravity doctor
codex-antigravity doctor --codex-ready
codex-antigravity doctor --live --live-model claude-sonnet-4-6
codex-antigravity doctor --byok-only
```

`doctor` parses the active Codex config, verifies `model_provider = "antigravity"` and the matching provider `base_url` when Antigravity is active, warns when PyPI has a newer package version, and exits non-zero on hard readiness failures. `doctor --codex-ready` additionally checks gateway reachability, `/v1/models`, route/account readiness, observed service state, read-only account/provider store accessibility and migration status, account-state schema version, and provider capability mismatches. `--json` exposes those fields under `diagnostics`. These store checks do not chmod, migrate, create encryption keys, or rewrite configuration. Add `--live` only when you want a real provider `/v1/responses` generation smoke; set `CODEX_ANTIGRAVITY_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to skip the once-daily package-version check.

Before tagging a release, run the local verification stack. Run credentialed live smokes only with explicit authorization and record them separately from local/package evidence:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_tests.py -q
python3 -m compileall -q codex_antigravity_auth tests
git diff --check
codex-antigravity models doctor
# Explicitly authorized only:
codex-antigravity doctor --codex-ready --live --live-model claude-sonnet-4-6
```

The gateway binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Binding to a non-loopback host requires both `--allow-remote` and an `ANTIGRAVITY_GATEWAY_TOKEN` of at least 32 visible ASCII characters; remote callers must send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The built-in server still speaks plain HTTP, so use remote mode only behind a trusted tunnel, local network boundary, or TLS-terminating proxy.

And execute full unit test coverage:
```bash
python3 scripts/run_tests.py
```

The offline test runner isolates personal configuration and credentials before test
collection and denies network access except owned loopback fixtures. See the
[test contract](test_support/README.md). Install the development extra (`pip
install -e ".[dev]"`), including the explicit TOML parser dependency on Python 3.10.

CI and publish gates cover Ubuntu Python 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.14, Windows 3.12 and
macOS 3.12. To reproduce the package gates:

```bash
python3 -m build --sdist --wheel
python3 scripts/check_artifacts.py
python3 scripts/check_installed.py
```

The asset manifest in `codex_antigravity_auth/skill_assets.json` is checked against
the entire bundled skill tree and both archives, and is also used by skill
installation verification. Add new assets there when adding packaged helpers or
fixtures. Installed checks create fresh environments outside the checkout for the
wheel and rebuilt sdist, assert import origins, exercise real HTTP fixture flows,
and run the installed standalone Anti suite. They use synthetic state; platform
fixtures do not establish real Keychain, OAuth, or service-manager acceptance.

## Troubleshooting

### HTTP 403 VALIDATION_REQUIRED

If you see "Verify your account to continue" or VALIDATION_REQUIRED errors:

1. Check logs: `codex-antigravity logs --tail 20`
2. Reset accounts: `codex-antigravity accounts reset --all --yes`
3. Re-login: `codex-antigravity login --count 4`
4. The gateway now correctly surfaces 403 auth failures (not misreported as 429 rate limits)

### All Accounts Cooling Down

If all accounts are in cooldown:

```bash
codex-antigravity accounts reset --all --yes
codex-antigravity accounts list
```

### Project Discovery Failures

If project IDs are not being discovered:

1. Check logs for "Project discovery failed" warnings
2. Re-login to trigger fresh project discovery: `codex-antigravity login`
3. Verify accounts have project IDs: `codex-antigravity accounts list`

### Gateway Not Starting

```bash
codex-antigravity doctor --codex-ready
codex-antigravity start --port 51122
```

### Unified picker: OpenAI 401 / unknown model

If `gpt-5.6` returns 401, the OpenAI upstream has no credentials:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
codex-antigravity start --unified-model-picker
curl http://127.0.0.1:51122/health
```

If it returns 404 `Unknown model`, the id is not in the OpenAI registry,
native catalog, or BYOK config. Check `/v1/models`, extend
`ANTIGRAVITY_OPENAI_MODELS` if needed, and ensure the gateway was restarted
with `--unified-model-picker`. Classic mode never advertises OpenAI ids; use
the `antigravity-unified` provider block for unified pickers.

## Release Automation

Tagged releases are prepared for PyPI Trusted Publishing. The `.github/workflows/publish.yml` workflow runs on `v*` tags, requires the full Ubuntu Python 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.14 plus Windows Python 3.12 test matrix and a checked sdist/wheel build, then publishes with `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1` using OIDC (`id-token: write`) in the `pypi` environment. The tag must exactly match the package version.

Before the first PyPI publish, configure the PyPI project `codex-antigravity-auth` with a trusted publisher for this GitHub repository, workflow file `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, and environment `pypi`. No local PyPI API token is required or expected.
